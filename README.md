# Design-Patterns Demo
A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
Here I wrote in basic level, easily explainable java codes, to demonstrate various Design Patterns.

- Singleton Design Pattern :- Its a creational design pattern, which restricts the instantiation of a class to one object per JVM.

- Factory Design Pattern :- A creational type of design pattern, here we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created 
object using a common interface.

- Abstract Factory Design Pattern :- It work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. 
This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Abstract Factory pattern 
an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects 
as per the Factory pattern.

- Builder Design Pattern :- Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This type of design pattern comes under 
creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

- Prototype Design Pattern :- Prototype pattern refers to creating multiple duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. This type of design pattern comes under 
creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
